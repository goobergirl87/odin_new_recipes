# odin_new_recipes
Bitte lass es dieses Mal besser klappen. Der erste Versuch ging arg daneben. So ein Kaese.

Edit: The recipes project was the first real project of The Odin Project. First building a simple HTML page, later adding CSS to it. Apparently it didn't went how I wanted it. But this is a good reminder, that it will stay hard, but if you keep on going, there's a possibility that current challenges will look easy at some point in the future.
