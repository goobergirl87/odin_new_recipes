The first project in the curriculum of The Odin Project was to create a simple website with HTML. Since I already attempted making websites from scratch not everything was new to me. Still it was very helpful and necessary, to start from the very beginning. I got introduced to Git and its value in a work environment. Later in the curriculum the webpage is added by some CSS. My main problems at that stage were to find the right gif.

Seeing my code coming to life, gives me flashbacks of the early 2000s when my parents bought the first computer. Hearing the modem sound and opening the browser was pure magic and building webpages on my own now, feels like entering this mysterious world.
